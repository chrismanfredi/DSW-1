	<h2> Gameplay </h2>
		<p> <strong> Players fight either on foot as free-running </strong> "Pilots" or inside agile mech-style walkers 
called "Titans" to complete team-based objectives[2][3] on a derelict and war-torn planet[4] 
as either the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) or the Militia.[5] The game is 
online multiplayer-only, but adds single-player elements such as plot, character dialogue, 
and non-player characters (NPCs).[6] Bit-tech reported the game to have 15 maps, 33 weapons, 
and splitscreen support for the online multiplayer, though the developer had previously 
denied the latter.[7] Respawn founder Vince Zampella described the game as bringing <blockqoute> "scale, 
verticality, and story" </blockqoute> to first-person shooter multiplayer gaming.[8 </p>
		<p> <em> Up to twelve human players[9] </em> choose their pilot types and are dropped on the map, 
beginning the game.[10] A timer displays the time until a Titan can be deployed, which is 
reduced by killing other players.[10] Once deployed, Titans are protected by a forcefield 
for about 30 seconds, which protects the player-pilot as well.[10] Unlike player-characters 
in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield,[11] pilots are agile and accumulate momentum 
while running (similar to Tribes),[8] which lets players run on walls, chain together jet 
pack-enabled double jumps, vault over obstacles, and glide across ziplines.[11] There are 
multiple types of Titans, each with unique abilities and animations.[8] Pilot and Titan c
ontrols are identical except where the pilot's double jump becomes the Titan's dash,[8] as 
Titans cannot jump.[10] The Titans, somewhere between battle tanks and the robot mecha of 
Gundam and Macross,[11] are not slow, but their movement is slower than the nimble pilots.
[10] Titan game-balancing abilities include the vortex blocker, which stops and returns 
enemy ammunition in midair, and electrified smoke, which hurts and repels pilots climbing 
the Titan's back.[8] Pilot abilities include the Smart Pistol, which shoots around corners.
[12] Player-pilots can eject from Titans that take too much damage, and the Titan 
replacement timer is reset upon the Titan's death.[10] Titans can also act autonomously
when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their 
vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.[13] Games end with a race to the losing
team's evacuation dropship.[10] </p>
		<p> There are three Titan classes (the agile Atlas, the ponderous Ogre, and the nimble 
Stryder),[14] 15 multiplayer maps, and multiple multiplayer modes. In Attrition, a 
traditional Team Deathmatch, teams compete for the greatest kill count, and bot kills 
are counted. Pilot Hunter is similar to Attrition, but doesn't count bot kills. In 
Hardpoint Domination, the object is to capture and defend areas of the map. In Last Titan 
Standing, players begin the match in Titans and have a single life. There is also a Capture 
the Flag mode.[11] </p>
		<p> The game's "Campaign multiplayer" is separate from the game's "Classic" multiplayer. 
It plays as multiplayer with single-player elements, such as scripted cinematic sequences, 
non-playable character dialogue, and audio briefings. There are separate campaigns for the 
Militia and IMC factions, and the game randomly assigns the player to one for a series of 
nine maps.[11] The Militia are the civilian military of the Frontier and the resistance
 against IMC use of colony resources. Their most important members include Titan War 
 veteran and former mutiny leader MacAllan, intel specialist and engineer Bish, and 
 Marauder Corps leader Sarah.[15][16] The corporate conglomerate IMC specializes in natural 
 resource extraction, and came to the resource-rich Frontier for business. Their major 
 players are Frontier operations commander-in-chief Vice Admiral Graves, intel specialist 
 Blisk, and artificial intelligence companion Spyglass.[17][18] A new Titan chassis is 
 unlocked upon finishing each faction's campaign.[11] </p>
		<p> Titanfall is a mecha first-person shooter developed by Respawn Entertainment and 
 published by Electronic Arts. It was released on March 11th, 2014 in North America, and 
 is set to be released on March 13th, 2014 in Europe and Australia and March 14th, 2014 
 for the United Kingdom and New Zealand for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. An Xbox 360 
 port developed by Bluepoint Games is scheduled for a release of March 25th, 2014 for 
 North American and March 28th, 2014 for Europe. </p>

	<h3> Audio </h3>
		<p> The game's music is composed by Stephen Barton. He had previously worked on Call of Duty 
soundtracks and with Metal Gear Solid composer Harry Gregson-Williams. Titanfall's 
soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London,[41] with some specialty ethnic 
instrumentation recorded in Los Angeles.[42] Barton joined the project in early 2013. The 
game's E3 demo had sparse, placeholder audio and did not feature any final mixes, which 
were expected to be completed by November 2013. Barton sought to make the soundtrack 
"distinctive", with several main themes that build through the game.[41] The music was 
designed "as commentary", to not compete with the action.[43] As a multiplayer game, Barton 
produced a large number of tracks to avoid repetition. The sound ranges from "a very abused 
hurdy gurdy to heavy electronics" to "Morricone-esque baritone guitars".[41] Barton 
emphasized "taking sounds out </p>

		<td> Though Titanfall is somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and 
       customization features available at launch, its intense action is almost as exciting 
       to watch a friend play as it is to pick up the controller yourself. </td>

	<tr>
		<th> Digital Spy </th>
		<td> With such a generic narrative and no penalty for failing missions, the story 
       campaign lacks tension and fails to hold the attention. However, in Titanfall's case, 
       the failure to implement a strong narrative is ultimately inconsequential. Players 
       will tell their own stories simply by jumping and jetting through the vertical 
       environments, experimenting with parkour and, of course, causing destruction in the 
       seat of those towering Titans. </td>

		<td> We feel like this is next-gen gameplay. Titanfall proves that there's still 
       room for innovation in shooting games, and we've had a blast playing it. It could 
       have had next-gen visuals, though, and then it would have been the bomb. </td>
