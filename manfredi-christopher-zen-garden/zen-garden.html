		<h1> CSS Zen Garden </h1>
	 	<h2> Zen City Morning </h2>
	 	
	 	<p> The first design I looked at was zen city morning. I really liked this design
	 	because I use to live near new york city and this page has a city feel to it. I
	 	really like the skyline going along the side of the page with the sunset. Also the
	 	clouds add a peaceful feel to the page. I was looking at the css page and it looks
	 	like the author used css we are doing in class and it looks pretty basic. Hes using
	 	a lot of color, h3, backgrounds, and a lot of classes and a few ID's. I definitely
	 	couldn't do this design but in time and when I learn more I bet it won't be that 
	 	hard to create this design.  </p>
	 	
	 	<h2> Bugs </h2>
	 	
	 	<p> The second design I looked at was Bugs, I really liked this page because it is 
	 	really different with all bugs over the page on the different content sections. 
	 	I think the author did a good job with matching the contentent sections to the
	 	different bugs and it all goes well with that page. I looked at the CSS and it
	 	doesn't look like there is too many complicated terms I don't understand. This
	 	page seems pretty straight forward pretty basic. </p>
	 	
	 	<h2> Shaolin Yokobue </h2>
	 	
	 	<p> The third design I looked at was Shaolin Yokobue This design was very different
	 	to me and really caught my eye. I liked how different the page was and how it was a 
	 	single column website with a cook picture on the top. I looked at the css and it
	 	looked pretty simple with a lot of classes and basic terms I understood. </p>
