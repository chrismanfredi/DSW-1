		<h1> CSS Zen Garden </h1>
	 	<h2> Zen City Morning </h2>
	 	
	 	<p> The first design i looked at was zen city morning. I really liked this design
	 	because I use to live near new york city and this page has a city feel to it. I
	 	really like the skyline going along the side of the page with the sunset. Also the
	 	clouds add a peaceful feel to the page. I was looking at the css page and it looks
	 	like the author used css we are doing in class and it looks pretty basic. Hes using
	 	a lot of color, h3, backgrounds, and a lot of classes and a few ID's. I definitely
	 	couldn't do this design but in time and when i learn more I bet it won't be that 
	 	hard to create this design.  </p>
